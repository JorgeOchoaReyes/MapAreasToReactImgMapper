<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Using [image map generator](https://www.image-map.net/) can help speed the creation of area tags for images, but unfortunately [react-img-mapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-img-mapper) accepts its data as array of objects. We convert the data from image map generator to data that can be read by react-img-mapper so that you can spend more time detailing your image area tags and less time converting the data manually!
